# Spotify Connect API + React example
A project showing how `spotify-connect-ws` can be used to easily create a React app that works with Spotify's Connect API.

The app is live at https://spotify-connect-ws.netlify.com/, where you can see how the events work in response to changes that you make to an external spotify player. The app connects to the testing server (https://spotify-connect-ws.herokuapp.com/connect). You should feel free to use this url if interested in playing around with the lib. The code for this server is also available at https://github.com/lrholmes/spotify-connect-ws-server-example if you'd like to run your own.
